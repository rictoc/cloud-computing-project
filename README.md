## DISCLAIMER
For making this project we have been given a dedicated AWS account with a fixed budget, the resources and services used are **NOT** guaranteed to be **Free Tier eligible** and if you decide to deploy this stack with your personal AWS account **YOU MAY INCUR CHARGES**. Also this deployment makes use of some resources that were automatically provided to the Lab account and are therefore not provisioned as part of this stack.
