# Project for Cloud Computing course
M.Sc in Computer Science, Sapienza University of Rome, a.a. 2021/2022

The aim of our project is the creation and deployment on AWS of an age prediction deep learning based web application
using pre-trained models from [FairFace](https://github.com/dchen236/FairFace).

## Start the compose stack for development
```
docker compose up --build
```

## Roadmap ðŸ›£
