# Project for Cloud Computing course, a.a. 2021/2022
M.Sc in Computer Science, Sapienza University of Rome

The aim of our project will be the creation and deployment of a Deep Learning based web application. In particular we want to build an application based on the open-source, pretrained GAN (Generative Adversarial Network ) models presented in the 2021 paper [JoJoGAN: One Shot Face Stylization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11641).

## Start the compose stack for development
```
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up --build
```
